# Replication Package

In this repository we share all the code and the raw data about the JSEP paper title _Branch Coverage Prediction in Automated Testing_.

## Test Generation Scripts

The folder [tests-generation][test] contains the full scrips we used to generate the tests with both Randoop and EvoSuite.

## Full Results

The folder [complete-results][results] reports the full results of the employed algorithms for the different combination of tool and budget.
For the sake of space the paper reports only the ones for the best algorithm.

## Source Code 

In the [code][code] folder we provide all the scripts and the source code we used for our empirical study, along with some brief instruction that will help you in running the code.

## Plots

The folder [plots][plots] contains all the plots that we do not include in the paper for the sake of space.

## Raw Data

All the raw data are in the [data][data] folder.

## Projects

The source code of the projects we used in the study is available in the [projects][projects] folder.
